Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the application of Engineering principles, tools and methods to develop and maintain high quality system.
It ensures that software is of high quality, reliable and secure. This helps reduce risk and vulnerabilities.
It enable the creation of systems that can scale efficiently as user demand grows.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Early Programming (1940s - 1950s) - The creation of first electric computer where programmers wrote codes in binary or assembly language. 
Object-Oriented Programming and Design (1970s-1980s) - Where objects and classes were first used to model real world entities
Modern Software Engineering (2020s and Beyond)- The emergence of AI and Machine Learning which is being used to assist in coding.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. 

Requirement Analysis - This is a phase where stakeholders are interviewed to understand their need and expectation.

Designing - This is where the system is designed, it highlights all the major components that will be in the system.

Implementation - This is the phase where the actual source codes are written based design document. It usually follow the predefined guidelines and standards

Testing - This is the phase where the software is thoroughly tested to find and fix any bugs. This is done to ensure the software works as expected.

Deployment - This is the phase where the software becomes accesible to the end user. It also involves installation, configuration and training the user.

Maintenance - This is the phase where the software is updated and enhanced as needed to keep it with evolving technology.

Evaluation - This is the phase where the project is reviewed. This helps is accesing its success and identifying areas that will need improvement in future.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile can accomodate changing requirements while waterfall is rigid to changes.
Agile focuses on delivering working software with less emphasis on documetation while waterfall emphasizes through documentation.
Agile is iterative and flexible while waterfall is linear and sequential.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer -
Roles and Responsibilities:
Design, develop and maintain Softwares system
Debug and troubleshoot software problems to imrove functionality.
Write and review codes and making sure it adheres with the starndard

Quality Assurance Engineer - 
Roles and Responsibilities:
Collaborate with developers to produce and resolve issues
Ensure that software products meets quality starndard
Develop and execute test plans and test script to identify a problem

Project Manager - 
Roles and Resposibilities:
Identify the potential risks and develop mitigation strategies.
Communicates between the stakeholders, developers and Quality Assurance teams.
Monitors project progress and making sure milestones are achived


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs); Examples of (IDEs): Visual Studio Codes, InteliJ IDEA, PyCharm, XCode and CLion
It helps in streamlinig the development process by providing all the necessary tools in place. 
It helps in code management where it provide tools for organizing files and large codebases.
It helps in highlighting the syntax errors and potential bugs in the early stages of software development. It also help in identifying the source of error more easily.

Importance of Version Control Systems (VCS);Examples of (VCS):Mercurail, Git and Bazaar
It enable experimentation with new ideas or changes without affecting the original project.
It helps in tracking all the changes that were made.
It helps in collaboration where multiple developers can work on the same project simultiniously without overwriting each others change.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challanges:
Rapid technology change
Complexity in large projects
Speed and quality
Strategies:
They should always strive to learn new technology
Engage with the tech community so as to stay inforned about the new trends
They should try break down the large system into small system that can be easy to work on
By reviewing codes with peers helps in detecting issues.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing- It always focuses on verifying the components of system application. It helps in early detection of bugs, serves as a form of documetation showing out how different individual parts of a software are supposed to work and it helps making the maintanace of the system easier.

Integration testing- It involves testing the interaction between integrated units to see if they can work together. It helps in identifying the problems that can occure when two or more units are integrated, it helps in ensuring two or more units work together seamlessly and it also act as a bridge between unit testing and system testing so as to build system in a gradual manner.

System testing - It involves testing a complete and integrated software as a whole. It helps in verification of system functionality, perfomance, security and many other things, it helps in providing end-to-end evaluation of the system. Simillary, it helps in identifying environmental related issues.

Acceptance Testing- This involves conducting a test to determine whether a software meets the acceptance criteria set by the end-user. It helps in confirming that the software meets all the requirements and is ready to be used. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is a technique of crafting questions or statements to get the best answer possible from an AI model.
It helps avoid giving out vague questions which in turn can give confusing answers.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt "Describe my country Kenya"
Improved Prompt " Describe my country Kenya and where it is located in Africa, also highlight the main Economic activities and some of the tribes that are found there".
The improved version will give the AI model the precise topic that it will need to give answer to.
