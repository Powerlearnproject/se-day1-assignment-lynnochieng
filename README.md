Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the application of Engineering principles, tools and methods to develop and maintain high quality system.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Early Programming (1940s -1950s) - Creation of first computers which required programmes to be written in binary or assembly language.
Object-Oriented Programming and Design (1970s - 1980s) - The emergence of using objects and classes to model real world entities. 
Modern Software Engineering (2020s - Beyond) - Emerging of AI and Machine Learning are used to assist in coding, testing and project management.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - Understanding what the user wants in the software 
Analysis - 
Designing - 
Developing - 
Testing - 
Deployment - 
Maintenance - 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer -
Roles:
Design, develop and maintain Softwares system
Debug and troubleshoot software problems to imrove functionality.
Write and review codes and making sure it adheres with the starndard

Quality Assurance Engineer - 
Roles and Responsibilities:
Collaborate with developers to produce and resolve issues
Ensure that software products meets quality starndard
Develop and execute test plans and test script to identify a problem

Project Manager - 
Roles and Resposibilities:



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs);
Increased Productivity- 
Code Management - 
Debugging and Error Detection- It helps in highlighting the syntax errors and potential bugs in the early stages of software development. It also help in identifying the source of error more easily.
Importance of Version Control Systems (VCS);
It enable experimentation with new ideas or changes without affecting the original project

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is a technique of crafting questions or statements to get the best answer possible from an AI model.
It helps avoid giving out vague questions which in turn can give confusing answers.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt "Describe my country Kenya"
Improved Prompt " Describe my country Kenya and where it is located in Africa, also highlight the main Economic activities and some of the tribes that are found there".
The improved version will give the AI model the precise topic that it will need to produce.
